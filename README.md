# Econo Bank

## Introduction
Econo Bank is a simple banking application developed in Java, featuring a JavaFX Graphic User Interface (GUI) with design elements created in Corel Draw. This project was built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which enhances safety and encapsulation. It serves as a learning platform for JavaFX, building upon my previous experience with JavaSwing GUI. The application aims to provide a practical example of a banking system with a modern interface and robust backend storage using a SQL database.
